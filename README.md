# bluemangroup

Blue Man Group is the codename for the Blue Team infrastructure component of ISTS17.

## Deployment
**Please note** that deployment was performed one team at a time, instead of
deploying against all teams at once. The rest of this guide will assume that
you are also deploying against one team at a time. However, deploying against
all teams at the same time should not be difficult.

For ISTS 17, we deployed 14 teams in total - teams 1-13 were for competitiors,
and team 0 was an unused team for testing deployment and red team activities.
This guide will use team 0 as the example deployment team.

### Prerequisites
Before you can use this repository to deploy any teams, you will need to create
templates for each host in the host reference tables below. Each template's
hostname should be configured with the hostname listed in the tables below. In
addition, all templates must be accessible via Ansible. Make sure to configure
the files in `group_vars` properly.

Lastly, the network you use to deploy must have Windows DHCP and DNS set up.
Windows is specifically required because of the interaction between the DHCP
and DNS services. DHCP must be configured (in addition to typical options) to
send a domain name and update DNS records for clients. This will be used for
initial connectivity before hosts are assigned static IP addresses.

### Phase 1: Static IPs

## Host Reference
Notes about "global" services:
- Ping on all hosts
- WinRM on all Windows hosts
- SSH on all Linux/Unix hosts
